# Short Recap of VPN with Crypto Maps
Requirements:
* reachability between tunnel endpoints
* phase1 and phase2 paramters matching
* nat-traversal is now automatically detected but you may need to keep it active with: ```crypto isamkp nat keepalive```
  

Example config:
```

crypto isakmp policy 10
  encr aes 256
  hash sha512
  authentication pre-share
  group 24
!
  crypto isakmp key <KEY> address <PEER_IP>
!
crypto ipsec transform-set <SET_NAME> esp-aes 192 esp-sha384-hmac
  mode tunnel
!
ip access-list extended <CRYPTO_ACL_NAME>
    permit ip <SRC> <WILDCARD> <DEST> <WILDCARD>

!
crypto map <MAP_NAME> local-address <LOCAL_IP>
!
crypto map <MAP_NAME> 10 ipsec-isakmp
    set peer <PEER_IP>
    set transform-set <SET_NAME>
    match address <CRYPTO_ACL_NAME>
!
! apply the crypto map to the interface
! toward the <PEER_IP> (possibly to more 
! than on interface if routing can change) 
interface <X>
  crypto map <MAP_NAME>

! Need a route to forward traffic out of interface <X>
ip route <DEST> <MASK> <NEXT_HOP>

! show commands
show crypto isa sa
show crypto ipsec sa
```

# GRE over IPSEC with CRYPTO MAPs

GRE is IP Protocol 47
Notes:
* GRE is IP protocol 47
* The IP MTU is set on the tunnel to offload fragmentation to the end host.   
 * Don't Fragment (DF) bit is not copied by default from the original IP header to the inner GRE payload and further to the outer ESP header, so  
 hosts running Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD) over a GRE over IPsec tunnel will think that the end-to-end path MTU is larger than it is (because the packet is fragmented even if they did set the bit to 1)  
 By lowering the IP MTU to account for both ESP and GRE, the router will now generate ICMP Unreachable at a lower value when fragmentation is needed, as seen below.
*  that ```tcp adjust-mss``` is also required to be set to 40 bytes less than the mtu in the tunnel
The effect is to edit payload of a TCP three-way handshake if the MSS exceeds the configured value.  
The max MSS should be the *IP MTU minus 40 bytes (20 bytes for the IP header, 20 bytes for the TCP header)*. 
* you can also try to enale the replication of the **DF** bit in the tunnel with the command: ```tunnel path-mtu-discovery```

Configuration example:
```

interface Tunnel0
  ip address 192.168.0.1 255.255.255.0
  ip mtu 1400
  ip tcp adjust-mss 1360
  ! you can enable routing over the encrypted tunnel
  ip ospf 1 area 0
  tunnel source Loopback0
  tunnel destination <PEER_IP>
!

  encr 3des
  hash md5
  authentication pre-share
  group 5
!
crypto isakmp key <KEY> address <PEER_IP>
!
crypto ipsec transform-set <CRYPTO_SET_NAME> esp-aes esp-sha-hmac
  mode transport
!

```

# GRE over IPSEC with CRYPTO PROFILES

This is very similar to the use of crypto map but it just a pplies a profile to the tunnel

Configuration example:
```

crypto isakmp policy 10
  encr 3des
  hash md5
  authentication pre-share
  group 5
!
crypto isakmp key <KEY> address <PEER_IP>
!
crypto ipsec transform-set <SET_NAME> esp-aes esp-sha-hmac
  mode transport
!
crypto ipsec profile <PROFILE_NAME>
  set transform-set ESP-AES-128-SHA-1
!
!
interface Tunnel0
  ip address 192.168.0.1 255.255.255.0
  ip mtu 1400
  ip tcp adjust-mss 1360
  ! enable routing protocol if required
  ip ospf 1 area 0
  tunnel source Loopback0
  tunnel destination 150.1.8.8
  tunnel protection ipsec profile <PROFILE_NAME>

```

# IPSEC Virtual Tunnel Interfaces (VTIs)
IPsec Virtual Tunnel Interface (VTI) is a tunnel where the payload is directly encapsulated in ESP.
It is similar to GRE but:
*  overhead is 24 bytes lower
   * Remember GRE requires extra 20 (outer IP Header) + 4 (Actual GRE Header) 
* other non-IP payloads are not supported. (e.g. IS-IS)
* the IPsec Transform Set must use Tunnel Mode, because there is no other transport header

The configuration of a VTI is identical to a GRE over IPsec tunnel with a Crypto IPsec Profile, except that the **tunnel mode is set to IPsec IPv4 or IPsec IPv6**.  
* traffic must be routed inside the tunnel (you can use dynamic routing)
* Peer tunnel termination should be reachable not via the same protocol used in the tunnel

Configuration example:
```
crypto isakmp policy 10
  encr aes 192
  hash sha384
  authentication pre-share
  group 15
!
crypto isakmp key <KEY> address <PEER_IP>
!
crypto ipsec transform-set <CRYPTO_SET> esp-3des esp-md5-hmac
  mode tunnel
!
crypto ipsec profile VTI_PROFILE
 set transform-set <CRYPTO_SET>
!
!
interface Tunnel0
 ip address 192.168.0.1 255.255.255.0
 ip tcp adjust-mss 1406
 ip ospf 1 area 0
 tunnel source Loopback0
 tunnel destination <PEER_IP>
 tunnel mode ipsec ipv4
 tunnel protection ipsec profile VTI_PROFILE
```

Note that this tunnel can account for a correct **mtu**; you can see that using ```show interface tunnel0``` that should show **MTU 1446** (for IPSEC in tunnel mode with 54 overhead).  
Still a good idea however to set use the ```adjust-mss 1406``` with 1406 being the valueyou get by further removing the encapsulated IP + TCP header


# DMVPN

Dynamic Multipoint VPN (DMVPN) is a multipoint GRE-based tunneling technology.  
You have one or more hubs configured as **Next-Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP) Servers**  that create mappings between:
* The public IP address used for the tunnel source (**NBMA address**),
* The private IP address used inside of the tunnel.  

Major points:
* NHRP mapping is similar to ATM and Frame-Relays Inverse ARP.  
* Tunnels are created on-demand based on the particular destination of traffic.  
* Hub and spokes must agree on certain parameters, such as:
  *  NHRP authentication
  *  GRE tunnel key number
  *  Multicast support  
     Note that multicast works in way similar to frame-relay so, from an IGP routing point of view, 
     the spokes only learn routes from the hub as they don't see the ther spokes directly.  
* The spokes have a manual/static mapping between hubâ€™s tunnel address and NBMA address
* The hub dynamically learns about the spokes through NHRP messages. 


The first step to verify a DMVPN setup is to check that the spokes have registered with the hub correctly.

## DMVPN with no Encryption
This is the basic setup (no encryption used) for a **DMVPN phase1** setup where there is no spoke-to-spoke dynamic tunnel created

```
[HUB]
interface Tunnel0
 ip address 192.168.0.254 255.255.255.0
 ip nhrp authentication <KEY>
 ip nhrp map multicast dynamic
 ip nhrp network-id 1
 tunnel source <INTF_Y>
 tunnel mode gre multipoint
 tunnel key 2
 no shutdown



[SPOKE]
interface Tunnel0
 ip address 192.168.0.2 255.255.255.0
 ip nhrp authentication <KEY>
 ip nhrp map 192.168.0.254 <HUB_PUBLIC_IP>
 ip nhrp map multicast <HUB_PUBLIC_IP>

 no shutdown
!
! point some prefixes to the tunnel
! or use dynamic routing
ip route <PREFIX> <MASK> 192.168.0.254


! some useful show commands
show dmpvn
```


## DMVPN adding Encryption

The configuration is basically the same as before but in addition we need:
* Crypto isakmp policies and transform set
  * the HUB uses 0.0.0.0 as the Peer IP because it will accept connections from every IP
    You might want however to implement Certificates to prevent security issues..
    In this case for instance, if the key gets compromised, you have to change all SPOKEs keys..
  * ESP is used in **transport** mode because we already have a tunnel
* Add the tunnel protection ipsec profile <PROFILE_NAME> to the tunnel
  *  also note that the MTU will have to be lowered to 1400
* This is still DMVPN phase1 design.. so all traffic goes through the HUB
  * If you enable routing, remember to **disable split-horizone on the HUB**  
  * If you enable OSPF, the HUB tunnel must be set to **point-to-multipoint** (default for tunnel is point-to-point); then either:
    * the spokes are also changed to **point-to-multipoint**
    * the timers must be changed to match (either on the spokes (point-to-point) or on the hub )

Configuration example:
```
! SPOKE
crypto isakmp policy 10
  encr aes 128
  hash sha256
  authentication pre-share
  group 16
!
crypto isakmp key <KEY> address <HUB_PUBLIC_IP>
!
crypto ipsec transform-set <SET-1> esp-aes 256 esp-sha512-hmac
  mode transport
!

  ip nhrp authentication <TUNNEL_KEY_STRING>
  ip nhrp map 192.168.0.254 <HUB_PUBLIC_IP>
  ip nhrp map multicast <HUB_PUBLIC_IP>

  ip nhrp nhs 192.168.0.254
  ip tcp adjust-mss 1360
  tunnel source <SRC_INTF>
  tunnel destination <HUB_PUBLIC_IP>
  tunnel key 2

  group 16
!

  ip mtu 1400
  ip nhrp authentication <TUNNEL_KEY_STRING>
  ip nhrp map multicast dynamic
  ip nhrp network-id 1
  ip tcp adjust-mss 1360
  tunnel source <SRC_INTF>
  tunnel mode gre multipoint
  tunnel key 2
  tunnel protection ipsec profile DMVPN_PROFILE 
  no shutdown
```  


## DMVPN PHASE 2

In DMVPN Phase2, the spokes initially create a connection to the **HUB** but this time they are using a ```tunnel mode gre multipoint``` and the spokes can dynamically create tunnels towards other spokes so that forward plane traffic does not need to croos through the HUB.  
In orer to do this, the spokes need to learn about the prefixes in the topolocy that are behind spokes and in particular:
* The hub cannot summarize routes between the spokes
* The routing protocol used must support maintaining the next-hop of the spokes.
  * If you use **EIGRP**, this requires the command: ```no ip next-hop-self eigrp``` (if you use classic EIGRP) or the command: ```no next-hop-self``` under the **tunnel af-interface** in
    EIGRP Multi-AF 
    * The command: ```no split-horizon``` is still required
  * if you use **OSPF**:
    * change the network to either **broadcast** or **non-broadcast** : both network types require a DR and the DR will not change the next-hop ip
    * set ```ip ospf priority 0``` on the spokes
    * the spokes will establish a full neighbour only with the HUB but resolve the spoke IPs
      via NHRP when forwarding traffic

The spokes can then perfom next-hop resolution querying the **nhrp-server** configured, setup
the **IPSEC** tunnel and start forwarding traffic

Note that the configuration for the tunnel side is basically the same except the wildcard for the IKE key and the use of gre multi point; the actual difference is in the routing protocol configuration.

Configuration example:
```
! SPOKE
crypto isakmp policy 10
  encr aes 128
  hash sha256
  authentication pre-share
  group 16
!
crypto isakmp key <KEY> address 0.0.0.0
!
crypto ipsec transform-set <SET-1> esp-aes 256 esp-sha512-hmac
  mode transport
!
crypto ipsec profile DMVPN_PROFILE
  set transform-set <SET-1>
!
interface Tunnel0
  ip address 192.168.0.1 255.255.255.0
  ip mtu 1400
  ip nhrp authentication <TUNNEL_KEY_STRING>
  ip nhrp map 192.168.0.254 <HUB_PUBLIC_IP> 
  ip nhrp map multicast <HUB_PUBLIC_IP>

  tunnel key 2
  tunnel protection ipsec profile DMVPN_PROFILE 
  no shutdown


! -- somw useful show commands:
show ip nhrp
show dmvpn
show crypto isa sa
```

## DMVPN Phase 3

This is basically the same as Phase2 but sending a default route to the **SPOKEs**:
* In **EIGRP** you would configure a ```summary-address 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0``` on the **HUB** af-interface tunnel0 (or on the actual tunnel if you use classic eigrp)
* The HUBs also require the command: ```ip nhrp redirect``` on the tunnel interface
  and send a redirect
* The spoke also require the command: ```ip nhrp shortcut``` on the tunnel interface
  so that when they receive a redirect from the HUB, they create a new tunnel to the 
  spoke as instructed by the HUB  
   


## VRF AWARE DMVPN

This is used to implement something called: **Front Door VRF (FVRF)** where:
* Underlay routing in the spokes is done in a specific vrf
* The spokes can use a default route in the underlay vrf to establish tunnel
  * In the configuration example we configure a default static route but
    you can actually configure **BGP** in the underlay (and possibly in the overlay too)
    This makes the design more flexible, e.g. you can use a loopback as a tunnel source
    and advertise the loopback in the underlay BGP to establish connectivity over multiple paths, etc..
* The spokes will learn all the other routes (and possibly a different default) 
  via the tunnel (and keep those in the Global routing table)

Configuration notes:
* You need to use a vrf aware IPSEC config with a crypto keyring: 
  ```
  crypto keyring <NAME> vrf <UNDERLAY_VRF>
  pre-shared-key address 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 key <KEY>
  ```     
* tunnel source interface and underlay default must be in the <UNDERLAY_VRF>
* tunnel interface **IS NOT** in the <UNDERLAY_VRF> **but** in the global routing table
* tunnel interface must be made **vrf aware** with the command: ```tunnel vrf <UNDERLAY_VRF>```

Configuration example :
```

[UHB]
!
vrf definition UNDERLAY
  rd 1:1
  address-family ipv4
  exit-address-family
!
crypto keyring VRF_AWARE_PSK vrf UNDERLAY
  pre-shared-key address 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 key <PSK_KEY>
!
crypto isakmp policy 10
  encr aes
  hash sha256
  authentication pre-share
  group 16
!
crypto ipsec transform-set SET-1 esp-aes 256 esp-sha512-hmac
 mode transport
!
crypto ipsec profile DMVPN_IPSEC
 set transform-set SET-1
!
interface Tunnel0
 ip address 192.168.0.254 255.255.255.0
 ip nhrp authentication <TUNNEL_KEY>
 ip nhrp map multicast dynamic
 ip nhrp network-id 1
 ip nhrp redirect
 ip mtu 1400
 ip tcp adjust-mss 1360
 tunnel source <interface X>    ! source in the vrf : UNDERLAY
 tunnel mode gre multipoint
 tunnel key 2
 tunnel vrf UNDERLAY            ! -> this maskes the tunnel "vrf aware"
 tunnel protection ipsec profile DMVPN_IPSEC

interface <X>
 vrf forwarding UNDERLAY
 ip address <public IP> <mask>

ip route vrf UNDERLAY 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 <public IP next hop>

[SPOKES]
The spokes are configured basically in the sam way
The only difference is the NHRP config in the tunnel interface
that is the one for a spoke, i.e.
!
! (SPOKE SPECIFIC CONFIG)
ip nhrp map 192.168.0.254 <HUB_PUBLIC_IP>
ip nhrp map multicast <HUB_PUBLIC_IP>
ip nhrp shortcut    ! -> for phase3
!
instead of (HUB SPECIFIC CONFIG)
ip nhrp map multicast dynamic
ip nhrp redirect    ! -> for phase3

```

# Some MTU considerations

**GRE** can incapsulate multi protocol, not only IP but it requires
* 4 extra bytes for the GRE Header (point-point) or 8 extra bytes if the tunnel is point-to-multipoint 
* 20 Bytes for the Outer IP
If you only tunnel IP you can use ```tunnel mode ipip``` which only adds 20 bytes

**IPSEC** contains
* ESP constant: SPI(4) + SN(4) + PADLength(1) + NextHeader(1) = 10
* ESP-AuthData: always truncated to 12 Bytes
* AES-CBC (RFC 3602): IV(16) + MaxPadding(15)
* ESP in tunnel mode adds 20 Bytes for a tunnel IP Header. (Transport mode doesn't).

So overall MAXIMUM ESP(AES) overhead = 10 + 12 + 31 = 53. Obviously the padding cannot be odd, so use 54 as the MAXIMUM overhead.
The adjust-mss size should consider additional 20 bytes for TCP Header
